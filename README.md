## Project Proposal

We will create a webservice that acts as a travel guide for a specified city and dates. For this, we will use a flight service API (eg. KIWI), a hotel service API (eg, Booking), a car rental service API, weather tracker API, and/or restaurant API (YELP). The goal is to make a one platform service where all information for a trip can be found. We will most likely include blocking by price range.
